# HTTPD cJSON WiFi Manager  

The Example consists of HTTPD server:
    1. URI \ for GET command returns web page form
    2. URI \wifi\cred for POST command gather form variables 

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

### Test the example :
        * run the test script : "python scripts/client.py \<IP\> \<port\> \<MSG\>"
            * the provided test script first does a GET \hello and displays the response
            * the script does a POST to \echo with the user input \<MSG\> and displays the response
        * or use curl (asssuming IP is 192.168.43.130):
            1. "curl 192.168.43.130:80/hello"  - tests the GET "\hello" handler
            2. "curl -X POST --data-binary @anyfile 192.168.43.130:80/echo > tmpfile"
                * "anyfile" is the file being sent as request body and "tmpfile" is where the body of the response is saved
                * since the server echoes back the request body, the two files should be same, as can be confirmed using : "cmp anyfile tmpfile"
            3. "curl -X PUT -d "0" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" - disable /hello and /echo handlers
            4. "curl -X PUT -d "1" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" -  enable /hello and /echo handlers
